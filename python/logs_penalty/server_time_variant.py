#  * Throughout this interview, we'll write code to analyze a simple server process uptime log.
#  * These logs are much simplified, and are just strings of space separated 0's and 1's.
#  * The log is a string of binary digits (e.g. "0 0 1 0").
#  * Each digit corresponds to 1 hour of the server running:
#  *   "1" = <crashed>, "down" // server process crashed during the hour
#  *   "0" = <didn't crash>, "up" // server process did not crash during the hour
#  *
#  * EXAMPLE:
#  *   A server with log "0 0 1 0" ran for 4 hours and its process crashed during hour #3
#  *   hour: |1|2|3|4|
#  *   log : |0|0|1|0|
#  *              ^
#  *              |
#  *              down during hour #3
#  *
#  * We can *permanently remove* a server at the beginning of any hour during its operation.
#  * A server is on the network until it is removed.
#  * Note that a server stays POWERED ON after removal, it's just not on the network.
#  * We'd like to understand the best times to remove a server.
#  * So let's introduce an aggregate metric called a "penalty" for removing a server at a bad time.
#  *
#  * EXAMPLE:
#  *   Remove a server with log "0 0 1 0"
#  *   hour : | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
#  *   log  : | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
#  *   remove_at: 0 1 2 3 4 // remove_at being `x` means "server removed before hour `x+1`"
#  *              ^     ^
#  *   before hour #1   after hour #4
#  *
#  * We define our penalty like this:
#  *   +1 penalty for each DOWN hour when a server is on the network
#  *   +1 penalty for each UP hour after a server has been removed
#  *
#  * Further Examples:
#  *   hour : 1 2 3 4 // total penalty = 3 (3 server-up hours after remove)
#  *   log  : 0 0 1 0
#  *          ^
#  *          |
#  *          remove_at = 0
#  *
#  *   hour : 1 2 3 4 // total penalty = 1 (1 server-down hour before remove)
#  *   log  : 0 0 1 0
#  *              ^
#  *              |
#  *              remove_at = 4
#  *
#  * Note that for a server log of length `n` hours, the remove_at variable can range from 0, meaning "before the first hour" to n, meaning "after the final hour".
#  *
#  * 1a) Write a function: compute_penalty, that computes the total penalty, given a server log (as a string) AND a time at which we removed the server from the network (call that variable remove_at).
#  * In addition to writing this function, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's correct.
#  *
#  * Examples
#  *   compute_penalty("0 0 1 0", 0) should return 3
#  *   compute_penalty("0 0 1 0", 4) should return 1
#  *
#  * 1b) Use your answer for compute_penalty to write another function: find_best_removal_time, that returns the best remove_at hour, given a server log.
#  * Again, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's correct.
#  *
#  * Example
#  *   find_best_removal_time("0 0 1 1") should return 2
#  *
#  * 2a) Now that we're able to analyze single server logs, let's analyze some aggregate logs.
#  * Aggregate logs are text files that contain lots of logs.
#  * The files contain only BEGIN, END, 1, 0, spaces and newlines.
#  * Aggregate logs include some servers that arenâ€™t actually finished, so we might have some BEGINs scattered throughout.
#  * We'll only consider inner BEGINs and ENDs to be valid log sequences.
#  * Put another way, any sequence of 0s and 1s surrounded by BEGIN and END forms a valid sequence.
#  * For example, the sequence "BEGIN BEGIN BEGIN 1 1 BEGIN 0 0 END 1 1 BEGIN" has only one valid sequence "BEGIN 0 0 END".
#  * Write a function get_best_removal_times, that takes the file's contents as a parameter, and returns an array of best removal hours for every valid server log in that file.
#  * Note: that logs can span 1 or many lines.
#  * Again, you should use tests to demonstrate that your solution is correct.
#  *
#  * Example
#  *   get_best_removal_times("BEGIN BEGIN \nBEGIN 1 1 BEGIN 0 0\n END 1 1 BEGIN") should return an array: [2]
